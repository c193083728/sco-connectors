      Receive data from AWS Kinesis.

      The basic authentication method for the Kinesis service is to specify an access key and a secret key. These parameters are optional because the Kamelet provides a default credentials provider.
      
      If you use the default credentials provider, the Kinesis client loads the credentials through this provider and doesn't use the basic authentication method.
